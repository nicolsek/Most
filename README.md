# Most (May + Host)

This is a self-rolled minimalist hosting platform.  
I needed something to host my files and stuff so I decided to write it myself.  

### Prerequisites

* Node.js  
* Something to host this on.  

### Installing

`$ git clone https://github.com/nicolsek/most`  
`$ cd most`  
`$ npm install`  

## Deployment

Assuming you have a copy of most already and an up to date set of packages just...

`$ cd most`  
`$ npm install`  
`$ mv config-example.json config.json` <-- Please edit this to your liking.  
`$ node start`
